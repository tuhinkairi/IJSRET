              (The comments that follow are founded on Elsevier guidelines as
              well as COPE's Best Practice Guidelines for Journal Editors.)
            </p>
            <p>
              We at IJSEART (International Journal of Scientific Research in Engineering & Technology) strongly believe in following these guidelines to maintain fair practice. We are committed to fair practice of publication. Success in this regard can be achieved if the following participants will practice ethics:
            </p>
            <h6>Journal publishing ethics rules:</h6>
            <p>
              The International Journal of Scientific Research in Engineering
              and Technology is committed to ensuring ethics in the publication
              and quality of articles. The International Journal of Scientific
              Research in Engineering and Technology follows the Code of Conduct
              as defined by the Committee of Publication Ethics
              (COPE).https://publicationethics.org/files/u2/New_Code.pdf.
            </p>
            <p>
              These ethics include the editor following specific rules on
              relations with readers, authors, and reviewers and procedures for
              handling complaints. Conformance to standards of ethical behavior
              is therefore expected of all parties involved: Authors, Editors,
              Reviewers, and the Publisher. In particular,
            </p>

          <div>
            <h5>Authors:</h5>
            <p>
              Authors should present an objective discussion of the significance
              of research work as well as sufficient details and references.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors should maintain accurate records of data associated with
              their submitted manuscript and supply or provide access to these
              data, on reasonable request. Authors guarantee that all data used
              in the article are real and authentic. Where appropriate and where
              allowed by employer, funding body and others who might have an
              interest, authors should deposit data in a suitable repository or
              storage location, for sharing and further use by others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fraudulent or knowingly inaccurate statements constitute unethical
              behavior and are unacceptable.
            </p>
            <p>
              The authors should ensure that their work is entirely original,
              and if the work and/or words of others have been used, this fact
              has been appropriately acknowledged. Plagiarism in all its forms
              constitutes unethical publishing behavior and is unacceptable.
              Submitting the same manuscript to more than one journal
              concurrently constitutes unethical publishing behavior and is
              unacceptable. Authors should not submit articles describing
              essentially the same re-search to more than one journal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors should acknowledge the financial support and help/guidance
              of others if appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>Authors should provide the disclaimer if appropriate.</p>
            <p>
              All co-authors should significantly contribute to the International Journal Research. The corresponding author should ensure that there is a full consensus of all co-authors in approving the final version of the paper and its submission for publication.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors are obliged to participate in the peer review process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors should promptly notify the editor if a significant error
              in their publication is identified, and cooperate with the editor
              to publish an erratum, addendum, corrigendum notice, or to retract
              the paper, where it is deemed necessary.

          <div>
            <h5>Editors:</h5>
            <p>
              Editors have complete responsibility and authority to
              accept/reject a manuscript.
            </p>
            <p>
              Editors should evaluate manuscripts exclusively based on their
              academic merit. Editors act in a balanced, objective and fair way
              while carrying out their expected duties, without discrimination
              on grounds of gender, sexual orientation, religious or political
              beliefs, ethnic or geographical origin of the authors.
            </p>
            <p>Editors accept the paper when reasonably certain.</p>
            <p>
              Editors must not use unpublished information in the editor's own International Journal Research without the express written consent of the author.
            </p>
            <p>Editors preserve the anonymity of reviewers.</p>
            <p>
              When errors are found, editors promote International Journal Research Publication of correction or retraction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Editors should take reasonable responsive measures when ethical
              complaints have been presented concerning a submitted manuscript
              or published article.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h5>Reviewers:</h5>
          <div>
            <p>
              Any manuscripts received for review must be treated as
              confidential documents. Privileged information or ideas obtained
              through peer review must be kept confidential and not used for
              personal advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reports should be conducted objectively, and observations should
              be formulated clearly with supporting arguments, so that authors
              can use them for improving the paper. Any relevant published work
              which is not yet cited should be pointed out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any selected referee who feels unqualified to review the International Journal Research reported in a manuscript or knows that its prompt review will be impossible should notify the editor and excuse himself from the review process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reviewers should not consider manuscripts in which they have
              conflicts of interest resulting from competitive, collaborative,
              or other relationships or connections with any of the authors,
              companies, or institutions connected to the papers.
